    <!--Motivation-->
    <h3>Motivation to study coding skills</h3>
    <p>With my current and past work experiences, I have, sadly, realized that I do not love what I do for a living so I find it extremely difficult to keep my motivation. I feel that if you are going to invest 8 hours a day, 5 days a week in something, it should definitely be an activity you like and enjoy. So, following that train of thought, I have been thinking about a career change for around a year and I have been doing some short courses in coding (udemy, freeCodeCamp) in order to pursue that change.
     I believe that a coding bootcamp like this could really help me achieve getting new exciting job opportunities in the digital world.</p>
